# AI usage
Explain how you use the AI to solve the assignment. Put all ***your used queries*** in this section & what kind of AI are you using. Declare not using AI if you didn't do this.  
Answer: I used AI to explore and better understand the existing code. I asked the AI to explain how the logic in the code works by using prompts such as “explain the following line of code” and similar variations. The purpose was not to generate new code but to clarify the function and logic of the code that was already available.

# Collaboration usage
Explain how you are ***using others*** to complete the assignment in this section. Are they simply copying, learn the ideas, learn how to adapt the AI or anything involving the process. State the people if any & Please be elaborate. Declare self tought if you solved this by yourself. 
Answer: I collaborated with a friend who had already completed the code. I asked questions regarding the parts I was confused about and learned from their explanations. The goal was to understand their approach and reasoning behind certain parts of the code, not simply to copy their work.
